'''

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. 
For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. 
If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.
