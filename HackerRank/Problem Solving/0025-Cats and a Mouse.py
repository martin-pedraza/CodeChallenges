'''

You are given q queries in the form of x, y, and z representing the respective positions for cats A and B, and for mouse C. 
Complete the function catAndMouse to return the appropriate answer to each query, which will be printed on a new line.

If cat A catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
If cat B catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.
